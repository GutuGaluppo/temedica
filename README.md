# Getting Started

In the backend and frontend directory, you can run:

`npm install` to install the dependencies

Runs `npm start` on backend and frontend

- The API will be available under the [http://localhost:3001/api/drugs](http://localhost:3001/api/drugs) url.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the App in your browser.

## List of things to improve if I have more time

- I would improve the layout.
- Implement [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) to fetch, cache and update data.
- Typescript would be great as well.
- Test the application.
- Create separate Utils file to create generic functions.

## Final thoughts

- In general, it was very pleasant to do it.
- Some details I had to figured myself based on the mockup but there was no instructions to do it <em>(not sure if this was part of the challenge or not)</em>.
